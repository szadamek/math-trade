ðŸ”— Math-Trade is a system designed to support multi-party exchanges of board games and other items, inspired by the mechanism popularized on the BoardGameGeek platform.
Instead of simple bilateral trades, participants form complex exchange chains that optimize transactions using mathematical algorithms, maximizing the number of trades or participant satisfaction.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
    Automated processing of participants' offers and wishlists.
    Construction of trade graphs and optimization with advanced algorithms.
    Clear results presented in textual and visual formats for better decision-making.
    Scalable design â€“ suitable for small communities and large user groups alike.

ðŸš€ Project Goal:
To create an intuitive, modular tool that streamlines multi-party exchanges and opens up new possibilities for the Math-Trade community.
The systemâ€™s flexibility makes it applicable beyond board games, addressing resource exchange challenges in various domains.
